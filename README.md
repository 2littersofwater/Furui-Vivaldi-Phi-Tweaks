# Furui-Vivaldi-CSS
Be sure to go to [KaKi87's Phi for Vivaldi](https://github.com/KaKi87/phi-for-vivaldi)

This is my personal CSS that I use to fit my liking and just appended some things that I want to be included, very minor changes, but visually different (I think...). Based mostly on KaKi87's work so head to their repo and support them
