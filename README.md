# Furui-Vivaldi-CSS
Be sure to go to [KaKi87's Phi for Vivaldi](https://github.com/KaKi87/phi-for-vivaldi)

This is my personal CSS that I use to fit my liking and just appended some things that I want to be included, very minor changes, but visually different (I think...). Based mostly on KaKi87's work so head to their repo and support them, betlog

## Installation:

The Installation guide found in [KaKi87's Phi for Vivaldi](https://github.com/KaKi87/phi-for-vivaldi), is the same for this CSS.

## Features:

A lot of things, i am lazy to put screenshots

## Updates:

**Update V0.3 (9/3/2025)**
+ FIXED: Location of the removed New Tab (+) Icon is now clickable
+ Site Info Button and Page Load Info of the Address Bar is now located at the right side of the field
+ Organized Appended Codes

**Update V0.2 (9/2/2025)**
+ Adjusted the Tab container width (Replica of my Zen Setup)
+ Revamped the tab highlights
  + Pinned tab stays the same (Active Pinned Tabs are still highlighted with a glow effect)
  + Non-pinned tabs are now highlighted differently (Active and Non-active Tabs have their ends as semicircles)
+ Vertical Tabs's Scrollbar is fixed
+ The New tab icon on the bottom is removed (The + icon)
  + **BUG**: The location of the + icon where it was supposed to stay is not clickable (tabs coinciding there cannot be clicked)
+ Much Larger and Much Rounder Address Bar (Replica of my Zen Setup)
