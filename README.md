# Furui-Vivaldi-CSS
Be sure to go to [KaKi87's Phi for Vivaldi](https://github.com/KaKi87/phi-for-vivaldi)

This is my personal CSS that I use to fit my liking and just appended some things that I want to be included, very minor changes, but visually different (I think...). Based mostly on KaKi87's work so head to their repo and support them

## Installation:

The Installation guide found in [KaKi87's Phi for Vivaldi](https://github.com/KaKi87/phi-for-vivaldi), is the same for this CSS.

## Features:

A lot of things, i am lazy to put screenshots

**Update (9/2/2025)**
+ Adjusted the Tab container width (Replica of my Zen Setup)
+ Revamped the tab highlights
  + Pinned tab stays the same
  + Non-pinned tabs are now highlighted differently (Corners are semicircles)
+ Vertical Tabs's Scrollbar is fixed
+ The New tab icon on the bottom is removed (The + icon)
