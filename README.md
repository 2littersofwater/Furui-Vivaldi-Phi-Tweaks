# Furui-Vivaldi-CSS
Be sure to go to [KaKi87's Phi for Vivaldi](https://github.com/KaKi87/phi-for-vivaldi)

This is my personal CSS that I use to fit my liking and just appended some things that I want to be included, very minor changes, but visually different (I think...). Based mostly on KaKi87's work so head to their repo and support them

## Installation:

The Installation guide found in [KaKi87's Phi for Vivaldi](https://github.com/KaKi87/phi-for-vivaldi), is the same for this CSS.

## Features:

A lot of things, i am lazy to put screenshots

**Update (9/2/2025)**
+ Adjusted the Tab container width (Replica of my Zen Setup)
+ Revamped the tab highlights
  + Pinned tab stays the same (Active Pinned Tabs are still highlighted with a glow effect)
  + Non-pinned tabs are now highlighted differently (Active and Non-active Tabs have their ends as semicircles)
+ Vertical Tabs's Scrollbar is fixed

+ Much Larger and Much Rounder Address Bar (Replica of my Zen Setup)
